# Overview
________________________________________________________

In this `concepts` section, we will describe the key concepts that are at the core of BlindLlama. Each section contains an introduction to the concept itself followed by a discussion of how we use these technologies in BlindLlama.

The concepts we will cover are:

+ [**Hardened systems**](./hardened-systems.md): We describe how we use hardened systems to eliminate data exposure, even to our admins
+ [**Trusted Computing Base (TCB)**](./TCB.md): We detail which elements of our computing base are trusted or attested
+ [**Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs)**](./TPMs.md): We explain how we use TPMs to provide cryptographic proof that our privacy and security measures are in place
+ [**Attested TLS**](./TPMs.md): We describe how we combine secure communications with attested hardened environments to provide robust end-to-end data protection and prove we are communicating with our hardened environment
