    "BlindLlama is a zero-trust API for querying open-source models, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Serves models in a zero-trust hardened environment**. Even our admins cannot access or view any user data!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Provides robust technical proofs** that users are communicating with **an authentic BlindLlama server deployed within a zero-trust hardened environment**. This means users have technical guarantees that we cannot access or use their data!\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a Python package which you can easily download and use to query our models. Currently, we serve the [Llama2 70b](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b) model, but we will serve more popular open-source models in the near future.\n",

    "BlindLlama's client SDK is based on that of `openai` to facilitate uptake for end users are already familiar with their SDK.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The `prompt` option is a string input containing your query input text. Feel free to modify the `prompt` option below to test the API with new prompts!\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `model` option allows you to select the model you wish to use and is set to Llama-2-70b by default. We currently only support this model, but will add more models in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `temperature` is the sampling temperature and should be a value between 0 and 1. The higher the value, the more random the output will be. The lower the value, the more deterministic it will be. The `temperature` option is set to 0 by default. This will make the model use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `completion.create()` method returns the response of the model as a string."
