# About & Privacy - BlindChat

## Privacy

<em>Last updated: September 15, 2023</em>

No conversations are recorded. All computation happens on your device, and conversations are stored locally in the browser’s cache.

We don’t and never will see your data, so we cannot train on your data. Your data remains yours.
